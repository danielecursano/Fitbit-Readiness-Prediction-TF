# Fitbit Readiness Prediction with TensorFlow

## Overview
This repository contains code for predicting readiness using TensorFlow based on data collected from Fitbit wearable devices. The project focuses on preprocessing Fitbit data, training machine learning models with TensorFlow, and predicting readiness levels based on biometric measurements and other factors.

## Features
- Data preprocessing pipeline for cleaning and transforming Fitbit data.
- Implementation of machine learning models using TensorFlow for readiness prediction.
- Evaluation and validation of model performance.
- Example notebooks demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.

## Repository Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
